                <p>For my course requirements analysis we had to do a group-project in which we had to create a Use case diagram and every corresponding use case description.
                We had to do this for a teacher playing our client, the client had an application that we had to build.
                We learned how to do meetings with a client and how to work in team to create a project.
                </p>

                <h3>Use case Diagram</h3>
                <p>The use case diagram is a way to display how a user interacts with the system you are trying to build.
                The use case diagram you see above is the one we came up with when working on our project.</p>
                <h3>Prototyping</h3>
                <p>After our use case diagram was finished we had to build a prototype. Prototypes are a way to show your client how the application you are build will look when it's finished.
                </p>

                <h1 class="text-center pb-2">Case study</h1>
                <p>For my DevOps course in school I had a project where I made a Web Application with ASP.NET and Contentful.
                Contentful is a service which allows you to handle data. It works with multiple programming languages, but I did my project with .Net.
                I create a simple pokedex which showed all the gen 4 pokemon.</p>
                <img src="images/caseStudy.png" alt="">
                <p>The fun thing about this project was working with .NET.
                This was the first time working with this language, so it was a challenge to create a project without knowing the language, but it was fun to learn.</p>
                <img src="images/caseStudy2.png" alt="">
                <p>Contentful was a fun twist to this project, it allowed me to work with content in an OO way without having to use a database and write my own sql.</p>
